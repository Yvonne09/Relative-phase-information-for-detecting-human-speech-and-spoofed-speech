# Relative-phase-information-for-detecting-human-speech-and-spoofed-speech

Recently, speaker verification technology has been used in many applications, such
as a telephone banking, customer services,Authentication of gates, so security is
very important and needs to prevent from spoofing attack.Any professional can make
synthetic speech which is exactly same as natural speech, Anyone can use replay
speech as spoof speech,which is more easy then other attacks. There are many
different kinds of methods for detection of human speech and spoofed speech.
However, in this project I am going to use relative phase information extracted from a
Fourier spectrum is used to detect human and spoofed speech. Because
original/natural phase information is almost entirely lost in spoofed speech,so in this
project i will analysis the Relative phase shift of signal and extract RPS features and
the relative phase information is also combined with the Mel-Frequency Cepstral
Coefficient (MFCC) and Modified Group Delay Coefficient(MGDC).To accomplish
this project i am going to use “ASV spoof 2015 : Automatic Speaker Verification
spoofing and countermeasures challenge” database.
